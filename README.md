### üöÄ **Easy Meme Creation**

At Goldeng, we simplify the creation of memecoins with just a few clicks, removing the usual complexities of launching a new token.

- **Trade Instantly**: Every time a meme is created, you can trade it without needing to provide liquidity.
- **Bot Protection**: We've implemented a security system to protect against bots. More on this in our [security documentation](#).

### üéâ **Staking Rewards**

1% of the total supply of each token is allocated to staking rewards. This encourages a virtuous cycle, helping new tokens gather more holders and fostering a strong community from the start.

### üèÜ **Hall of Fame**

Some memes reach legendary status, and many people would love to own a virtual or physical version of their favorite meme.

- **DAO-Driven Initiative**: This area allows the community to create and receive physical meme collectibles.
- **Legal and Secure Payments**: To ensure compliance with legal requirements, we use **Coinbase** for payments. For countries with crypto restrictions, users can choose to receive their meme collectible in NFT format.
- **First Edition NFTs**: While there‚Äôs no max supply for these NFTs, the first 5000 will include a wallet containing a small amount of random memes.

### üíé **Degen: Trade Memes from Day One**

For each token created:
- A liquidity pool is set up with **1 wei** and a small fraction of the new tokens, enabling trading from the get-go.
- 10% of the token supply is airdropped to a smart contract, with a minimum contribution of **0.0001 ETH**. This ETH is added to the liquidity pool, making it possible to trade memes with low liquidity but still enough to have fun.

For more details, check out the contracts and how this system works on our [GitHub](#).
