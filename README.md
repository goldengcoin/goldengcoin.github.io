## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Many people are venturing into the world of cryptocurrencies, drawn by the appeal of memes. However, many of these enthusiasts are new to crypto but have a deep love for memes, many take advantage of these people. This is where Goldeng comes in. Our mission is to make the entire process fast, simple, enjoyable and safe.

Easy Meme Creation:
At Goldeng, we simplify the creation of memecoins with just a few clicks, removing the usual complexities of launching a new token. Every time a meme is created you can trade it without the need to put up liquidity. In addition, it contains a security system to avoid bots. We explain how later.

Staking Rewards:
1% of the max supply of each token creation is dedicated to staking rewards, which encourages a virtuous cycle that also helps new tokens have more holders.

Hall of Fame:
There are memes that become very famous, many people would like to have a virtual version or a real version of their meme, this area is for the DAO, the objective is to create toys and give them physically, using a payment like Coinbase or some exchange that has KYC, if it is a country with crypto restrictions you can choose to get it ont in NFT format. These NFTs do not have a Max supply but the first 5000 of these NFTs will have a wallet which contains a small amount of random memes.

Degen:
Every time a token is created, a liquidity pool is created with 1 wei and a very very small percentage of the tokens created, which makes it possible to trade these tokens from the beginning, 10% of the supply of these tokens is given as an airdrop in a smart contract, in exchange a minimum of 0.0001 eth is requested, this eth goes to the liquidity pool, doing this makes it possible for anyone to trade any meme with very little liquidity, but enough so that they can have fun trading them, the details of the contracts and how this system works are detailed on the github.
