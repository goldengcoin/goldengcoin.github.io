# **Goldeng: The Future of Meme Coins**

Many people are venturing into the world of cryptocurrencies, drawn by the appeal of memes. However, a lot of these enthusiasts are new to crypto but have a deep love for memes, which makes them vulnerable to exploitation. This is where **Goldeng** steps in. Our mission is to make the entire process fast, simple, enjoyable, and safe.

### üöÄ **Easy Meme Creation**

At Goldeng, we simplify the creation of memecoins with just a few clicks, removing the usual complexities of launching a new token.

- **Trade Instantly**: Every time a meme is created, you can trade it without needing to provide liquidity.
- **Bot Protection**: We've implemented a security system to protect against bots. More on this in our [security documentation](#).

### ‚öôÔ∏è **Smart Launch (Optional Feature)**

Our **Smart Launch** feature allows creators to launch memecoins with an initial **100% sell fee** that gradually decreases over a set period. This feature can be customized during token creation, enabling you to define how long the sell fee will reduce to 0%. For example, if a creator sets the duration to 2 hours, the sell fee will gradually decrease from 100% to 0% over that time frame.

- **Applies Only to Sell Transactions**: The fee only impacts selling, not buying.
- **Prevents Early Sales**: This mechanism helps prevent bots or early sellers from exploiting the token right after launch.
- **Customizable Duration**: You choose the time period during creation for how long the sell fee will decrease.

### üéâ **Staking Rewards**

1% of the total supply of each token is allocated to staking rewards. This encourages a virtuous cycle, helping new tokens gather more holders and fostering a strong community from the start.

### üèÜ **Hall of Fame**

Some memes reach legendary status, and many people would love to own a virtual or physical version of their favorite meme.

- **DAO-Driven Initiative**: This area allows the community to create and receive physical meme collectibles.
- **Legal and Secure Payments**: To ensure compliance with legal requirements, we use **Coinbase** for payments. For countries with crypto restrictions, users can choose to receive their meme collectible in NFT format.
- **First Edition NFTs**: While there‚Äôs no max supply for these NFTs, the first 5000 will include a wallet containing a small amount of random memes.

### üíé **Degen: Trade Memes from Day One**

For each token created:
- A liquidity pool is set up with **1 wei** and a small fraction of the new tokens, enabling trading from the get-go.
- 10% of the token supply is airdropped to a smart contract, with a minimum contribution of **0.0001 ETH**. This ETH is added to the liquidity pool, making it possible to trade memes with low liquidity but still enough to have fun.

For more details, check out the contracts and how this system works on our [GitHub](#).
